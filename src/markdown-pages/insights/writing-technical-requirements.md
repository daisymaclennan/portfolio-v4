## Stakeholder Interviews

Following an initial meeting on 14th January 2019 with Rosie, the client, I have been able to gather some basic details which should allow me to start initiating the project. Rosie’s business is in photography, taking appointments inside their Southsea based studio and travelling to events such as weddings, corporate events or anything that requires a photographer. She is the only photographer available in her business however if more coverage is needed for large events she is able to find an additional photographer for more money. The objectives for her website are to allow previous customers to access their images digitally through a login area from which they will also be downloadable, to accept bookings online which will be organised in a way which is simple to understand and to display her work in a visually pleasing and organised way. Additionally, she would like to have a section dedicated to her personal story and qualifications, an Instagram feed showing up to date images, an area for her to blog about her photoshoot experiences and for all images to have watermarks added to them to prevent image theft. Rosie has specified a personal budget of £7000 and a deadline of June 18th 2019.

## Requirements

Having a detailed, well understood and agreed set of technical requirements is vital for the successful development of a piece of software in which the end-user and customer are satisfied.

Although a set of requirements will be written at the beginning of the project prior to design, Agile allows these requirements to be tweaked when needed. Requirements can simply be described as a feature or function that the software requires in order for the project to be considered successful. The first way which I have decided to simply represent these requirements is using bullet points based on the information I was given during the stakeholder meeting.

*   Personal information page
*   Booking system
*   Instagram feed
*   Photo portal with downloadable images and personal logins
*   Blog

## Use cases

To further develop my understanding of these requirements and direct our features towards users I am also going to write a use case. This will allow our team to easily see all interactive scenarios with the system, we can use this to generate success criteria for the project and use both documents to communicate to the client what we are going to include in the project. It is vital that the specific information on all aspects of the project is signed by the client so that any dissatisfaction could only be due to human error such as the client forgetting to mention a feature which they were expecting.

## Wireframes

In addition to this, I also assisted the software designer in drawing wireframes. Wireframes are monochromatic sketches drawn by hand or graphically which outline sizes and placement of page elements, site features and navigation for a website. They do not include anything such as font choices, colour or anything related to the design so that focus is solely on the structure of the site. This is another way to clearly show clients requirements whilst avoiding any specific terminology which may not be easy to understand. The picture below shows the wireframes we made which were drawn on a whiteboard.

## Technical specification

I have written a technical specification including all of the details which the stakeholder wanted including additional ideas which I personally felt would benefit the website. I have written this specification using user stories in the format “As a”, “I want”, “So that” and written acceptance criteria for them in the form “Given”, “When”, “Then”. Writing user stories in this format can be advantageous as writing in the first person can help readers envision the circumstances as if they were the person in question this will generate more realistic scenarios.

This version of the specification will be reviewed by the stakeholders. I have included brackets on details which need to be clarified with the client with which I will inquire about over email. I have also had another member of the team read through my draft technical specifications and leave me comments using Google Docs to ensure that it is the best and the most accurate it could be, the version of my technical specification attached is the final where I have resolved the comments.

The issue I was having which led to this comment was that I did not understand that the photographer may also be included in user stories. After being left this comment I was able to replace some user stories which were previously written from the customer’s point of view, it was more complicated to explain them in this way therefore by changing them my technical specification became more clear and understandable for the client. Using my use case diagram I was easily able to see the inputs and outputs of the application. I have highlighted all boxes which were edited.
