The process in which development teams organize their tasks is commonly determined by a software development methodology. A software development methodology is a way of structuring and monitoring the progress of a project efficiently. The most commonly used methodologies are Waterfall and Agile.

### Waterfall model

The Waterfall model uses a sequential approach to developing software. This means that there is a clear sequence of steps in the process, each of these steps must be completed fully before the next may begin. A benefit of using the Waterfall method is that definitive requirements can be agreed between the developers and customers very early in the development lifecycle which makes the course of planning and designing simpler. In addition to this, the progress of the project is easily managed since the process is well understood and clear for all to understand, including customers. Furthermore, this process may be viewed as simpler for customers as their presence is not necessary once the requirements phase is passed. However, in this case, requirements must be very clear and well discussed to ensure that the end product is exactly what the customer is expecting. Many customers can find it difficult to picture the appearance of a product based on the requirements document, to aid this wireframes may be used to give a more detailed idea. The largest risk of using the Waterfall method is that a customer may be dissatisfied with the end product since they are unable to see a good idea of what will be delivered until the end stages of the development life cycle, furthermore, changes will become increasingly difficult and expensive as the project progresses.

### Agile model

Agile software development is a collective term for a group of frameworks and practices based on the values written in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. The primary focuses of Agile are on cross-functional teams with the ability to self-organize and collaborate on tasks. One of the frequently used frameworks in Agile is Scrum. Scrum uses an incremental or in other words iterative technique for progressing through a development project. This works by breaking up the project into iterations/sprints which are planned at the beginning of the project with a focus towards fulfilling all of the project’s requirements. At the beginning of a sprint, the team will discuss the team backlog for the sprint and summarize the work completed in the previous sprint (iteration planning). The team backlog represents everything the team needs to do to progress. Next, the team will execute all goals in the sprint, collect user stories for the next step and may also complete functionality testing (iteration execution). Now they will review all the executed work and ask the customers to revise all new features to ensure that all of the criteria have been met (iteration review). Finally, the team will evaluate the entire sprint and work on any improvements which have been identified (iteration retrospect). New problems may arise in this stage and team backlogs will be revised and changed for relevance. Throughout the duration of a sprint a daily scrum, short meeting, is completed to assess the progress towards the sprint goal. A perk of using Scrum is that it optimizes productivity which leads to rapid delivery of the final product. As well as this, the Scrum framework encourages customer involvement and allows them to supply feedback during each iteration after which relevant changes will be made, therefore, this makes the framework adaptable and will avoid the risk of drastic and expensive changes needing to be implemented. Overall, Scrum allows developers and customers to consistently evolve their ideas allowing them to exceed the expectations. Nevertheless, this approach makes it difficult for teams to predict costs, time and resources required early on in the project which can be important to some clients. In addition to this Agile also requires time and commitment from all team members as well as being in close proximity to allow for face to face communication. It also requires time and effort from the clients which may be inconvenient for busy individuals.

Depending on the requirements of a project and the team which is available to execute it either Agile or Waterfall could be a more ideal approach to developing it. But when completed correctly Agile would be the most effective and efficient way to develop software. If someone is developing a project individually, which is unlikely, or are working in a team who work remotely and are not always available to communicate, the Waterfall method would be more appropriate. This is due to the fact that they would not be able to execute the Agile approach effectively and the lack of communication could lead to increased project completion time and render all of the benefits of Agile untrue. Sometimes clients may not have the time to work closely with developers or may wish to outline clear requirements at the very beginning of the project in which case the Waterfall method could be used. Furthermore, clients may also want to be given a fixed price included in their contract, due to the difficulty in predicting cost in the Agile method this may also lead to a team using the Waterfall approach. Although the Agile method would still be feasible in this situation it may cause stress on the team due to fixed timeframes.

### Applying Agile development to Rosie’s Photography project

I thoroughly explored the process of Agile development during the Rosies’ Photography project by deeply involving myself in each of the stages of the software development lifecycle.
